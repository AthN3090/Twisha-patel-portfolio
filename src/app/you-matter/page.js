                Self-care is a popular topic these days, but it is often poorly
                explained. It is not synonymous with self-indulgence or being
                selfish. Self care at the simplest level is making sure that you
                are doing the things that you need to do in order to stay
                healthy physically and mentally. Caring for yourself is an
                active choice that you need to make everyday that prioritizes
                your own health and happiness.

              <p>
                That sounds simple, but most people struggle to incorporate self
                care into their daily routines. With self-care being such a
                prevalent and subjective topic, my goal was to better understand
                how people approach self care and what challenges they face down
                the road of self improvement.‚Äã

                Designing the app has been a challenging and rewarding journey.
                It was clear from the onset that the major challenge will be to
                make users feel warmth and stay motivated to complete their
                routines and be consistent. I understood the needs of the users
                through the survey and conversations. Finally, I faced the
                challenge of creating an engaging app both from the user
                experience perspective and the visual perspective.{" "}
