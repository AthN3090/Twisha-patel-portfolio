              My name, Twisha, carries the beautiful meaning of &quot;divine aura.&quot; I
              am a self-taught UX designer based in Gujarat, India. My journey
              in this field has been quite interesting. Even though I studied
              computer science, I soon discovered that my real love is UX
              Design. It&apos;s the perfect mix of solving problems and being
              creative.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              My heart truly lies in crafting seamless and delightful user
              experiences. I&apos;m wholeheartedly dedicated to solving problems
              through design. I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities
              to learn and grow. <br></br>
              <br></br>
              When I&apos;m not designing, youâ€™ll often find me creating some sort of art, solving puzzles, or or simply enjoying with dogs. Apart from this, I swim, cycle, and play badminton to stay active. <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. ðŸ–¤
