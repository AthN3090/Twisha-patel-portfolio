              My name, Twisha, carries the beautiful meaning of &quot;divine aura&quot;.
              My journey as a UX designer has been quite an interesting one.
              While my academic background is rooted in computer science, I
              quickly realized that my true passion lies in UX Design. This
              field provides the perfect balance of problem-solving and
              creativity. <br></br><br></br>
              My heart truly lies in crafting seamless and
              delightful user experiences. I&apos;m wholeheartedly dedicated to
              solving problems through design. I am constantly on the lookout
              for opportunities to learn and grow. <br></br><br></br>
              When I&apos;m not designing,
              you&apos;ll often find me creating some sort of art, solving puzzles,
              or or simply enjoying with dogs. Apart from this, I swim, cycle,
              and play badminton to stay active.<br></br><br></br>
              Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. ðŸ–¤
